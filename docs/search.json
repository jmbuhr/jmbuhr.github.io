Buhr\nComputational Biochemist\n [ comment ]   [ comment ]   [ comment ]   [ comment ]   [ comment ] \n\nHi!\nI am a PhD student in the Molecular Biomechanics group of Prof. Dr. Frauke Gräter at the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS). I study the chemistry of collagen under physical stress using computer simulations.\nI very much enjoy thinking about mental models and teaching concepts with a focus on data analysis with the programming language R. Have a look at my current courses here. Being a mentor on the R for Data Science online learning community enables me to help new R users and I enjoy the challenges that come with solving the diverse set of problems from the many fields that these users come from.\nMy academic interests are balanced out by climbing, theater projects or creative work with the open source 3d software blender.\n\n\n\n",
