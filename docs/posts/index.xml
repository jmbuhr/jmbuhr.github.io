      <description>The Dunning-Krueger Effect is Probably Not Real   I recently came across this article by Jonathan Jarry (&amp;ldquo;The Dunning-Kruger Effect Is Probably Not Real&amp;rdquo; n.d.).
I am not going to try and steal his thunder, so please do go ahead and read the article. It is well written, thoroughly researched and presents a valid point. Everything points towards the Dunning-Krueger effect being largely just an artifact of the way the original authors analyzed their data.</description>

      <description>Join the Dark Side!   &amp;hellip; we have cookies.
There are many motivations to adding a dark mode to your site. I just like it, when things look consistent. So I also want my site to reflect that. But because at the same time I am also not very good at making things look consistent, which is why I mostly outsource design choices as much as I can. Here, for example, this means that I took the color values for the dark theme from the amazing nord color palette.</description>

      <description>Teaser   The Father (by Florian Zeller) tells the story of a father-daughter relationship, put under strain by the increasing dementia of the father. The story is told from the perspective of the father, André, and allows the audience to see the world through his perspective - with all the disjunctures, confusion and distress that dementia causes.
The production is co-directed by Dennis Massmann and Timothy Williams (previously &amp;lsquo;Twelve Angry Men&amp;rsquo;) and integrates this modern dramatic farce with elements of physical theatre to transport the audience into the mind of André.</description>

      <description>Teaser   A young man is accused of having killed his father, the evidence points in this direction, the witnesses corroborate the story against him. His fate rests in the hand of a jury - twelve men and women to decide if he should be executed. Eleven jurors are certain he is the murderer, but for one some questions remain open. This Anglistic Seminar performance approaches a modern classic from a fresh perspective, drawing the audience into the moral conundrum.</description>

Math     Example from the mathjax demo:
When a ≠ 0, there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
