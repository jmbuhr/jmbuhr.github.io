Greetings Adventurers,

And welcome to the next iteration of my introductory
R course for data visualization and analysis.
Because the concepts you will learn in this course
will be most useful in areas where the working language
is English, this course will also be in English.
But feel free to ask questions in German as well any time.
Let us start with the formalities.

## Sign up

In order for us to stay connected during the course, please
send me an email via my [contact form](../../contact.html) and mention
your name, as well as the course you are referring to (bachelor,
master).
I will not use your email address other than to contact you for
the course.

## Schedule

I am running this course twice to better answer
your questions during Office Hours.
The first batch for the Bachelor students starts
on November 2, 2020.
The second batch for the Master students starts
on January 11, 2020.

Starting November 2, 2020, I will upload a lecture video of about 1 hour
every Monday (8 in total, the last one is going to be shorter due to Christmas).
Corresponding exercises will be discussed during virtual Office Hours
via a video conferencing tool the following Friday at 10:00 (the first is on Nov 6).
The exercises are not graded, but in order for me to confirm your
attendance I ask you to send in at least 6 of the 8 exercises prior
to the Office Hour.
This also allows me to better answer your questions
during the course.
Speaking of questions, I
will also set up a messaging platform ([discord](https://discord.com/))
for you to discuss and ask
questions outside of the Office Hours.
You will get a confirmation mail with further details.

## Preparation and material

you can download them here:
