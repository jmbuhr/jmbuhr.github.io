I'm Jannik, a PhD student in the [Molecular Biomechanics](https://www.h-its.org/research/mbm/) group of [Prof. Dr. Frauke Gr√§ter](https://www.h-its.org/people/prof-dr-frauke-grater/) at the [Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies](https://www.h-its.org/) (HITS).
I study the chemistry of collagen under physical stress using computer simulations.

I very much enjoy thinking about mental models and teaching concepts
and focus on data analysis with the programming language R.
Have a look at my current courses [here](/teaching).
Being a mentor on the R for Data Science [online learning community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/)
enables me to help new R users and I enjoy the challenges that come with
solving the diverse set of problems from the many fields that these users come from.

My academic interests are balanced out by regular theater projects or creative work with
the open source 3d software [blender](https://www.blender.org/).
