I am a PhD student in the [Molecular Biomechanics](https://www.h-its.org/research/mbm/) group of [Prof. Dr. Frauke Gr√§ter](https://www.h-its.org/people/prof-dr-frauke-grater/) at the [Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies](https://www.h-its.org/) (HITS).
I study the chemistry of collagen under physical stress using computer simulations.

I very much enjoy thinking about mental models and teaching concepts
and focus on data analysis with the programming language R.
Have a look at my current courses [here](/teaching).
Being a mentor on the online [Data Science Learning Community](https://dslc.io/)
enables me to help new R and Python users and I enjoy the challenges that come with
solving the diverse set of problems from the many fields that these users come from.

Lately, I have been writing a bunch of lua, since it is the language used both for plugins of the code editor [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) and the [quarto](https://quarto.org/) computational document system.

My academic interests are balanced out by theater projects with the [Drama Group of the Anglistics Seminar](https://ssg-as-heidelberg.de/) of Heidelberg University.

You can also find me on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@jmbuhr), where I publish content about Neovim, Quarto and Data Science. For example, check out my video on getting started with Neovim:
