I am a PhD student of [Computational Science & Engineering](https://www.ingwiss.uni-heidelberg.de/en/research/scientific-profile/computational-science-engineering) at the Faculty of Engineering Sciences of Heidelberg University and in the [Biomolecular Mechanics group](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/en/graeter) of Prof. Dr. Frauke Gräter at the [Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/).
I study the chemistry of collagen under physical stress using computer simulations.\
With the defense coming up, you can already read my PhD thesis here: [jmbuhr.de/phd-thesis/](https://jmbuhr.de/phd-thesis/).

I very much enjoy thinking about mental models and teaching concepts
and focus on data analysis with the programming language R and Python.
Have a look at my current courses [here](/teaching).
Being a mentor on the online [Data Science Learning Community](https://dslc.io/)
enables me to help new R and Python users and I enjoy the challenges that come with
solving the diverse set of problems from the many fields that these users come from.

Lately, I have been writing a bunch of lua, since it is the language used both for plugins of the code editor [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) and the [quarto](https://quarto.org/) computational document system.

My academic interests are balanced out by theater projects with the [Drama Group of the Anglistics Seminar](https://ssg-as-heidelberg.de/) of Heidelberg University.

You can also find me on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@jmbuhr), where I publish content about Neovim, Quarto and Data Science. For example, check out my video on getting started with Neovim:
