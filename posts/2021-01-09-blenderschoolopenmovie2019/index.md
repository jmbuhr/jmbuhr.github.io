At the end of the Summer 2019 we got together as a group that met at the [blender3d Summer School](https://blender3dschool.de/), a yearly event with [blender](https://www.blender.org/) workshops, to produce a short movie within 2 weeks.
This is the result:

You can learn more about it on the [project website](https://blender3dschool.de/waln0t).
I was very lucky to work with such talented and inspirational people and am proud of what we achieved in such a small amount of time.
Prior to this it had been quite a while since I had last worked with blender, but I kept up to date with the development as it is one of my favorite Open Source projects and a testament to the power of an open community and passionate developers.
