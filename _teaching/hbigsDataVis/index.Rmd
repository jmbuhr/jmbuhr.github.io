Greetings Adventurers,

And welcome to the next iteration of my introductory
R course for data visualization and analysis.
Because the concepts you will learn in this course
will be most useful in areas where the working language
is English, this course will also be in English.
But feel free to ask questions in German as well any time.
Let us start with the formalities.

## Sign up

I will not use your email address other than to contact you for
the course.

## Schedule


## Preparation and material

For the course we will use R inside of Rstudio,
you can download them here:

- [Download R](https://cran.uni-muenster.de/)
- [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

The course material and exercise solutions will get
their own little website in due time and the link
will also be found here:
