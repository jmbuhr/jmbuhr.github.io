How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments\" [@krugerUnskilledUnawareIt1999].\nAnd it feels so right that the skills required for an accurate self-assessment would be linked to the skills required for the actual task.\nNow, this is not completely wrong.\nLater studies also found that experts are better at predicting their scores than lesser skilled participants (and so are women compared to men, by the way) [@nuhferHowRandomNoise2017].\nBut what they didn't find was the directionality claimed by Dunning and Krueger,\nwhere lesser skilled participants are supposedly more likely to be overconfident while higher skilled participants tended to rather underestimate their skills.\nLet's dive into some numbers to see, how this misconception arises.\n\n# Disecting a Dunning-Krueger Plot\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.showtext='false'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is what most plots in the original paper by Dunning and Krueger look like.\nAnd it looks very convincing at first glance.\nThe dots representing the actual scores of participants in a test\nare lower than the scores that participants estimated (squares) in the case of lower-scoring participants and the effect is reversed for higher-scoring participants.\nBut what is actually shown here?\n\n## What are Quantiles?\n\nFirstly, we must note that these 8 dots are summaries of many dots.\nAnd I always tell my students to be extra careful when someone only shows summaries and not the raw data behind those summaries.\nBut what kind of summaries are we dealing with here?\nDunning and Krueger hat a total of 87 participants, which where all psychology undergraduate students \n(We can talk about this selection bias another time, because we have a bigger problem at hand).\nThe original x-axis read \"Bottom Quartile, 2nd Quartile, 3rd Quartile and Top Quartile\", which I replaced with percentages.\nI did so, because these so called _quartiles_ are special cases of so called _quantiles_.\nAnd we are going to explore what those are now.\nThere might already be one such quantile that you are familiar with:\nThe **median**.\n\n> The median is the datapoint where half of all the other values are lower and the other half is higher.\n\nGenerally, quantiles are any number of points that divide your datapoints into equally sized pieces.\nIf you get 4 of those pieces, they are called quartiles.\nThe first quartile is the point such that one quarter, or 25% of datapoints, are smaller than that point.\nBy that logic, the median can have many names.\nIt could also be called the 2nd quartile or the 50th percentile.\nI chose the general notion of quantile and used percentages as labels because the problem we are about to uncover is a general problem, not just a problem of quartiles.\nAs we will later show, it will also appear if we use infinitely small pieces to divide our data with, so it is not a \"binning problem\" as I initially thought when I read that they summarized within the quartiles.\nSpeaking of summarizing, let's look into what happened to our raw datapoints.\n\n## Simulating the Data\n\nNow, Dunning and Krueger only had 87 participants.\nBut we are on a computer and we can simulate as many participants as we want,\nso let's start with 10'000!\nThis will also help to show that the problem is intrinsic to the way the data is summarized and not just a sample-size issue.\nWe will talk about the raw data and then make our way to the plot above.\n\nImagine we have all 10'000 participants take part in a test.\nThe lowest score they can achieve is 0 and the highest is 1.\nLet us also assume that all the participants have some sort of skill,\nwhich we are trying to measure with the test.\nIt is important to note here that this makes our test just a proxy for this skill.\nAnd it is a limited proxy.\nEven if we leave aside that the performance of any individual can vary from day to day (we are sort of making up for that by testing a lot of people), there is still a fundamental limit in our scoring.\nThe lowest score you can get is 0, even though among those that will score a 0, some will be higher and some lower skilled than their peers, and still they all have the same score.\nThe same goes for a score of 1.\nIf we are the highest skilled participant, we would get a score of 1, but other participants that are less skilled would also get a 1.\nSo the actual skill-distribution might be wider than our score distribution between 0 and 1.\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.showtext='false'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis cutoff means that we are getting more 0s and 1s than the other scores.\nAt this point this might not actually be a problem and it really depends on how much the skills and achievable scores are spread out, but it will be a much bigger problem once we ask participants for their self assessment.\nBecause self assessments can vary a lot.\n\nImagine this: For every score that a participant gets, it is equally likely that he or she has a higher or lower self-assessment:\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.showtext='false'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\"Hang on!\", you say: \"there are some illegal scores in there!\".\nAnd you are correct.\nBecause we can get scores lower than 0 and lower than 1, the\nself-assessment can't have those as well.\nAfter all, who would think that they got 120% in a test?\nOr a score of -0.3 where 0 is the lowest possible score?\nAnd this is the crux.\n\n## A Cutoff-Effect\n\nThose participants will be forced to apply a cutoff to their self-assessment so that it lies within 0 and 1.\nCrucially, when participants are equally likely to over or underestimate their skill,\nthose whose actual skill is low are more likely to run into the cutoff on the lower end.\nThose whose actual skill is high will run into the cutoff on the upper end more often.\nThis means that on the lower end of the skill spectrum, we are getting more self assessed scores that are 0, but would have been lower than that (e.g. -0.3) and on the other end we are getting more self assessed scores that are 1 but could have been higher than that if the scales allowed it.\nWhen we now summarize those values by first separating them into equally sized slices (the quantiles) and then calculating the mean (= the average) of all the points within those slices, something interesting happens.\n\nImagine rolling a die and calculating the average.\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.asp='0.2' fig.showtext='false'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe average of the numbers rolled will be close to 3.5.\nNow, what would happen, when every time you rolled a 1, you would write down\n2 instead?\nOf course, the average would increase!\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.asp='0.2' fig.showtext='false'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd the same happens on both ends of the skill-assessments and scores, just in opposite directions.\nSo let's look at the raw numbers behind the plot I initially showed you.\n\n## Behind the Curtain\n\nThe dark points and lines are the familiar averages just like in the original Dunning and Krueger plot.\nBut now we can also inspect the individual scores and self-assessed scores.\nThe individual points are colored by the quartile to which they belong.\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.showtext='false'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./preview-image-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow we see the cut-off in full effect.\nAnd it doesn't even matter that we used quartiles, any number of quantiles would have done.\nThe size of this effect only depends on the spread of the self-assessments, which is usually quite large.\n\n## Towards the Continuum\n\nFor example, if you use 10 quantiles, we can still observe the effect.\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.showtext='false'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThere is one more thing to take care of.\nIn my plots I used the actual and the perceived scores on the axis,\nwhereas Dunning and Krueger actually used quantiles on both axis.\nWe can show that the effect is independent of how many quantiles we take and still holds up if we use quantiles for the perceived scores by transitioning to the most general notion of what a quantile does.\nA **rank** captures the essential idea behind a quantile, without having to decide on the number of quantiles.\nThe rank of a value is just the number of values that are below that value.\nFor example, the average house mouse has a body length of about 8 centimeters, the average human male is 171 and the average human female is 159 cm tall while an average giraffe is 500 cm tall.\nThe rank of those values is the order of those vales:\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.showtext='false'}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n       mouse   human male human female      giraffe \n           1            3            2            4 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf we use this rank procedure to transform the actual and perceived scores, this is what we end up with:\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.showtext='false'}\n:::
